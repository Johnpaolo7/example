<!--      You are a developer building a task management application for a small business. The
application features a list of tasks displayed as an unordered list (<ul>), where each task is an
<li> element containing a "Delete" button. The client wants users to be able to remove tasks by
clicking the corresponding "Delete" button, and they’ve asked for a confirmation in the console
whenever a task is deleted. You’ve implemented a single event listener on the list container
using event delegation to handle all delete actions efficiently. However, during testing, a team
member noticed that clicking anywhere on the list (not just the buttons) also triggers a console
message, and they’re worried this might confuse users or indicate a bug. Your task is to
determine what happens when a "Delete" button is clicked versus when the list itself is clicked,
and explain why the current implementation behaves this way.

Hint:
Consider how event delegation works in this setup. The event listener is attached to the <ul>
element, so it captures all click events within its scope. Think about what event.target

represents and how the event bubbles up from the clicked element to the listener. The condition
inside the listener decides what action to take based on the clicked element’s class. -->
