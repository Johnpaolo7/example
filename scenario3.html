<!-- You are a UI developer working on a dashboard for a company’s internal tool. The dashboard
includes a nested structure: a grandparent <div> representing a section, a parent <div> for a
subsection, and a child <button> that triggers an action. Each element has a click event listener
attached to log a message, intended for debugging purposes during development. A colleague
testing the dashboard reports that when they click the "Click Me" button, the console messages
appear in an unexpected order—starting with "Grandparent Clicked!" instead of "Child
Clicked!"—and they’re concerned this might affect the intended functionality. Your task is to
predict the console output when the button is clicked and explain why the events fire in this
particular sequence, so you can reassure your colleague or adjust the code if needed.

Hint:
Focus on the parameter (true) in each addEventListener call. This setting enables the capturing
phase, which changes how events propagate through the DOM. Think about the hierarchy of
the elements (grandparent → parent → child) and how the event flows from the outermost to the
innermost element during this phase. -->
