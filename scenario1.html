<!-- You are a front-end developer working on an interactive webpage for a client. The webpage
includes a nested structure of elements: a grandparent <div>, a parent <div>, and a child
<button>.
Each element has a click event listener attached to it, and the client has reported that when
users click the "Click Me" button, the console logs messages in an order they don’t understand.
They expected the button’s message ("Child Clicked!") to appear first, since it’s the element
being clicked, but that’s not happening.
Your task is to figure out what the console output will be when the button is clicked and
determine why the events are firing in that specific order.
The client needs a fix or an explanation by the end of the day.
Hint:
Pay attention to the argument in each addEventListener call—it’s set to true. This setting affects
whether the event is processed during the capturing phase (top-down) or the bubbling phase
(bottom-up). Consider the nesting of the elements and how the event flows through the DOM
from the outermost to the innermost element. -->
